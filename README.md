# GPU-BranchDivergence
This project evaluates the algorithm of reducing the branch divergence when test source code on GPU machines. The project is the experiment for the following paper: Reducing Branch Divergence to Speed up Parallel Execution of Unit Testing on GPUs. The paper is under review on STVR Journal.
